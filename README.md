# F.I.R.E.SAT

### Building a 3U CubeSat to combat the spread of wildfires.

## TL;DR
F.I.R.E.SAT (Fire Intervention Rescue Expedition Satellite) is a student-led CubeSat concept designed to monitor and detect wildfires from low Earth orbit. This project adds detailed CAD Modelling in Autodesk Inventor with intense FEA Testing in Ansys to create a flight-ready satellite chassis. Additionally, a CNN was retrained in MATLAB to detect fires from an augmented dataset of terrestrial fires and achieved ~94% accuracy, which was then implemented into a pipeline created in Simulink to simulate downlinking logic from orbit.
