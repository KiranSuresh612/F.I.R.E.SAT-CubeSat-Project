# F.I.R.E.SAT

## Building a 3U CubeSat to actively combat the spread of wildfires
F.I.R.E.SAT (Fire Intervention Rescue Expedition Satellite) is a self-conducted project where I designed a 3U (10 cm x 10 cm x 30 cm) cubesat that can withstand launch and low Earth orbit conditions, all while using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) retrained using augmented terrestrial pictures to detect fire signatures and downlink them using a Simulink pipeline.
